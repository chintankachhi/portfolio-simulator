This program calculates the portfolio values based on its mean and standard deviation.
MonteCarloPortfolioSimulation.java is the driver of this program and it has a main method that is used to run the program that calculates the values of aggressive and very conservative portfolio after 20 years. It uses the following test values for the risk and the return given in the java programming challenge for testing purposes:
Portfolio Type - Aggressive: Return (Mean): 9.4324%, Risk (Standard Deviation): 15.675
Portfolio Type â€“ Very Conservative: Return (Mean): 6.189%, Risk (Standard Deviation): 6.3438
